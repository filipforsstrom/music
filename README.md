Various JACK music tools and experiments implemented in Zig

Includes a MIDI stream parser (midi.zig) an SMF parser (SMF.zig) and an
SMF player library (SMFStreamer.zig).

# Tools

## autoconnect

Listens for new JACK ports and automatically connects them according to a
rule file with rules in the following format:

    connect "source1:port" to "destination1:port"
    connect "source2:port" to "destination2:port"
    disconnect "source3:port" from "destination3:port"

* It accepts wildcards (`*` and `?`) in the port names.
* Clients are disconnected only if there are no matching connect rules
* It reloads the rule list every time something is connected or a new port is
  created, so you can change the rules without restarting it.

## smfplay

An SMF player. Starts playing the given file once connected to a MIDI sink.

Options:

* `--gm`: Perform GM Start reset SysEx before playback
* `--gs`: Perform GS reset before playback
* `--mt`: Perform MT reset before playback
* `--noresetcc`: Don't reset controllers before playback

## jack-activesensing

Simply generate a steady stream of MIDI active sensing messages.

## midivis

Visualizes all the incoming MIDI notes on one keyboard display for each
channel.
